A Stellaris mod based on the Human Domestication Guide universe created by GlitchyRobo  

Instructions:  
Copy contents of \mod into your Stellaris mod directory  
Typically this is located at C:\Users\\{username}\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Stellaris\mod  
Replace the path= line in Domestication.mod with the path to the mod  
Enable mod "Domestication" in your Stellaris launcher  
Enjoy!  

The primary feature of this mod is a new Civic called "Domesticators"  
This civic requires Xenophile ethics and is mutually exclusive with the Warrior Culture, Shared Burdens and Slaver Guild civics  
The civic unlocks the "floret" job, creating 1 floret job slot for every 8 planet pops.  
The floret job requires the Residency and Chemical Bliss species rights (the civic unlocks Chemical Bliss at game start)  
Chemical Bliss's effects are modified for Domesticators, instead providing a 5% happiness bonus and a -7% resource production malus, as well as a 50% reduction in pop demotion time and a 50% reduction in resttlement cost.  
Researching the Subdermal Stimulation technology will increase the happiness bonus to 20% and the resouce malus to -10%.  
Additional floret job slots are provided by higher-level planet capital buildings, as well as by housing districts if the player has selected the Prosperity - Interstellar Franchising tradition.  
The bonus florets from Interstellar Franchising replace the normal bonus clerk jobs from this tradition.  
Domesticators get a +10 base bonus and +10% production bonus to consumer goods to balance out the increased consumer goods upkeep from the Chemical Bliss living standard.  

In addition, I have included my takes on the Affini Empire and Terran Accord civilizations.  Neither of these in-game representations should be considered canon.  
To use these civs, copy the contents of \custom_civs\user_empire_designs.txt into your user_empire_designs.txt file.  
This file is typically located at C:\Users\\{username}\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Stellaris\user_empire_designs.txt  


I welcome any and all feedback and criticism from users as I strive to balance canon with game balance and the inherent limitations of Stellaris.  

To-do list:  

Affini empire emblem  
Bee sprites for Beeple  
Domestication Wars - Create protectorate with Affini main species  
Pop trait for Haustoric Implant to be automatically added to floret pops  
Add happiness malus to planets with low/no florets?  
Domesticating leviathans  
Leader traits to represent a floret - small bonus and malus so this doesn't get too OP  
Events!
